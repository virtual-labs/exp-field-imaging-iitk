#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Students will acquire bright field image | 1 Simulator will enable the students to play with the virtual controllers and understand its operation.  | 1 Learning about the bright field imaging
2.| Students will acquire dark field image | Simulator will guide the students about the steps to be followed  | Learning about the dark field imaging
